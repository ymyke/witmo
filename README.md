## üé≤ Usage

### Basic command

Make sure your phone is connected, unlocked, and camera app is open. Then run Witmo. Here's what my usual command looks like:

```bash
python ./witmo.py -c -d -a ding -s all=high story=none -g "elden ring"
```


### Main command line options

| Option                  | Description                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `-g`, `--game`          | **Required**. Name of the game being played   |
| `-d`, `--delete-remote` | Delete captured images from phone             |
| `-s`, `--spoilers`      | Set spoiler levels (see below)                |
| `-c`, `--crop`          | Auto-crop images to the TV/screen area        |
| `-a`, `--audio`         | Audio mode: `off`, `voice`, `ding`, or `both` |

Show all options with `-h` or `--help`. The remaining options are mostly for debugging and testing purposes.


### Spoiler control

You can control what types of spoilers Witmo is allowed to reveal using the `--spoilers` flag:

| Level    | Description                                        | Example                                                                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`   | Generic advice; no names/locations/items/bosses    | "Pay attention to the dialogue‚Äîit may clue you in on what's coming next."                         |
| `low`    | Broad hints; indirect, no proper nouns             | "Some characters' backstories become important later‚Äîkeep an ear out for their personal details." |
| `medium` | Concrete strategies; names, item categories        | "After you meet the Silver Regent in Act II, her true motives will shape the final chapters."     |
| `high`   | Full deep details; stats, coordinates, plot twists | "In Chapter 5 you'll discover that the Mentor was the antagonist all along."                      |

You can set spoiler levels for different categories:
- `items`, `locations`, `enemies`, `bosses`, `story`, `lore`, `mechanics`
- `all` for a blanket setting across all categories

You can combine these in a single command. For example, to set all spoilers to medium, story to none, and mechanics to high:

```bash
--spoilers all=medium story=none lore=high mechanics=high
```

Behind the scenes, the settings are added to the system prompt sent to the AI. So this depends on the model's ability to respect these preferences. 



## üß† Language models

Witmo currently supports 3 OpenAI models (o3, gpt-4o, and gpt-4.5-preview) and you can switch between them at runtime.



### Conversation History

Witmo maintains conversation history to provide context for the AI:

- Each game has its own conversation history.
- History is stored in the `history/<game-name-slug>` directory. (So please make sure to use consistent game names.)
- Images are saved for future reference.
- The most recent 10 messages are sent to the LLM for context.


### System prompt

Check out [`llm/system_prompt.py`](llm/system_prompt.py).


## üîä Audio Features

Witmo offers several audio options to enhance your experience:

### Audio Modes

| Mode    | Description                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `off`   | No audio feedback (default)                                                    |
| `ding`  | Play a notification sound when responses arrive                                |
| `voice` | Use text-to-speech to read AI responses aloud (using OpenAI's TTS API (tts-1)) |
| `both`  | Combine notification sounds and text-to-speech                                 |



## üóÇÔ∏è Prompt Packs

Witmo uses "prompt packs" to provide game-specific advice and context. A prompt pack is a file (see [`prompt_map.json`](prompt_map.json)) that defines tailored prompts for a particular game. 

- If a prompt pack exists for your game (like Elden Ring), Witmo will use it automatically for more specific advice.
- If no prompt pack is found for your game, Witmo falls back to a default set of prompts designed to work generically with most games.
- You can create and add your own prompt packs to extend Witmo for new games ‚Äî just add your custom prompts to the [`prompt_map.json`](prompt_map.json) file. If you do, please consider contributing them back to the project so others can benefit too.



## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome! If you have suggestions, bug fixes, or want to add features or additional prompt packs, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Game support:** Currently only Elden Ring is fully supported out of the box. You can use Witmo with any game by adding a prompt pack, or rely on the default prompts for unknown games.
- **Platform testing:** Only tested on Windows with PowerShell/Terminal and Python 3.11. No testing has been done on other operating systems, shells, or Python versions.
- **Device compatibility:** Only works with Android devices (tested with Pixel 8). Other Android models, iOS devices, webcams, or other capture methods are not tested or supported.
- **LLM providers:** Only certain OpenAI language models are supported at this time.
